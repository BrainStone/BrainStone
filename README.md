### Welcome

I'm Yannick and I develop software. I tend to take pride in my work so if you find any issues, just let me know and I'll do my best to iron them out ASAP!

- Currently working at @nitrado and working on Open-Source projects of all kinds in my free time
- Fun fact: Even though most of my stuff here is Minecraft related and written in Java, my favorite language is C++ <3
- Still using `master` as the primary branch #nokinkshaming
- The best way to reach me is Discord: https://discord.me/bungeechat (BrainStone#6759)
